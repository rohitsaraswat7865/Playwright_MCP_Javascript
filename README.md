# Playwright_GitHub_Copilot_SelfHealing_Javascript

Automated browser testing suite using **Playwright Test Generator Agent**.

## Overview

This project contains end-to-end automated tests for the Swag Labs e-commerce application. Tests are written in TypeScript using Playwright's testing framework and executed in headed mode for visibility during test runs. Refer - https://playwright.dev/docs/test-agents

**Test Generation**: Tests are automatically generated using the **Playwright Test Generator Agent**, which records user interactions and generates reliable test code.

**Self-Healing**: The test suite utilizes **Playwright Self-Healing Agents** to automatically fix broken locators, reducing maintenance overhead and improving test stability.

## 🤖 Test Generation Workflow

This project uses an **AI-powered test generation workflow** with Playwright agents:

### How Tests Are Generated

1. **Test Planning**: Test scenarios and steps are defined in `specs/test-plan.md`
2. **Test Generation**: The **Playwright Test Generator Agent** reads the test plan and generates test code by:
   - Recording user interactions with the application
   - Identifying reliable selectors and locators
   - Creating test steps with proper assertions
   - Generating TypeScript test code in `tests/`

3. **Maintenance with Self-Healing**: The **Playwright Self-Healing Agents** automatically:
   - Monitor test failures due to broken locators
   - Suggest or apply locator updates
   - Maintain tests as the application changes
   - Reduce manual test maintenance overhead

### Generated Tests

All test files in the `tests/` directory were generated from the test scenarios defined in `specs/test-plan.md` using the Playwright Test Generator Agent.

Example: `test-plan.md` → `tests/login-and-verify.spec.ts` (auto-generated)

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (v6 or higher)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

This will install:
- `@playwright/test` - Testing framework
- `@types/node` - TypeScript type definitions

2. Install Playwright browsers:
```bash
npx playwright install
```

3. Initialize Playwright Self-Healing Agents (optional but recommended):
```bash
npx playwright init-agents --loop=vscode
```

The self-healing agents help automatically fix broken locators and improve test stability over time.

### Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
npx playwright test
```

Run tests in a specific browser:
```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit
```

Run a single test file:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/login-and-verify.spec.ts
```

Run tests with headed browser (UI visible):
```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

### Viewing Test Reports

View the HTML test report:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```
